## [Kestrel](https://github.com/twitter-archive/kestrel) in Docker [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jiacai2050/kestrel-alpine.svg?style=plastic)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jiacai2050/kestrel-alpine/)

```
docker pull jiacai2050/kestrel-alpine
```

[The image](https://github.com/thefactory/docker-kestrel) from thefactory is based on [debian](https://hub.docker.com/r/thefactory/base/~/dockerfile/), which is too large in size.
So I create another one based on alpine, which is only 175MB.

## Versions

- OpenJDK 1.7.0_121 
- Kestrel 2.4.1
